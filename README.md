### Bookstrap Theme (Interface) for LazyLibrarian

Based on bootstrap 3. Optimised for responsive design from mobile to desktop.

## Usage

Files include styles and javascript additions to the default interface. Does not intefere, change or overwite any of the default interface.

Clone this into your LazyLibrarian data path and you should find "bookstrap" appears in your config as an additional interface / theme.

If you'd like to change the default theme you can edit the base.html file and change the "slate" css file to another name you can find here: [MaxCDN Bootswath Themes](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/)

In fact if you have anyother bootstrap 3 based theme you could replace it for your own.

## Known issues

As my focus is primarily on books the magazine section is somewhat under developed at this stage, but is catching up fast.
