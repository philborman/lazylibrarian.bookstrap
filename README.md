### Bookstrap Theme (Interface) for LazyLibrarian

Based on bootstrap 3. Optimised for responsive design from mobile to desktop.

## Usage

Files include styles and javascript additions to the default interface. Does not intefere, change or overwite any of the defaul interface.

Clone this into your LazyLibrarian data path and you should find "bookstrap" appears in your config as an additional interface / theme.

## Known issues

As my focus is primarily on books the magazine section is somewhat under developed at this stage.
